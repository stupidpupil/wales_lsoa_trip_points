# LSOA11 Trip-points for Wales and Bordering Areas

This repository contains geographical trip-points for each 2011 Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOA11) in Wales, and some LSOA11s in bordering areas in England, for transport-related analysis.

You can find [the code used to generate these trip-points, and some discussion of the advantages of disadvantages of using these trip-points, here](https://github.com/stupidpupil/wales_lsoa_trip_points/tree/main).

You probably want to download `lsoa11_nearest_road_points.geojson` - these are the final trip-points.

## Distance of Trip-points from Centroids

The plot below shows the distance of the trip-point from the population-weighted centroids for each LSOA.

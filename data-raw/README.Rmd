# LSOA11 Trip-points for Wales

This repository contains code to generate geographical trip-points for each 2011 Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOA11) in Wales for transport-related analysis.

It attempts to address the problem that for some LSOAs, particularly rural ones, the [population-weighted centroid](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/documents/b20460edf2f3459fa7d2771eacab51fc/explore) might be in the middle of nowhere - far away from any actual place, public transport stop or road. Trip planners may not be able to find routes to and from these centroids.

These "trip-points" are generated in a two-step process:
1. For roughly the third of Welsh LSOAs with the greatest areas, I find the village, town, bus stop, train station or pub nearest to the population-weighted centroid.

2. For each LSOA, I find the nearest motor-vehicle accessible road to a) the place found in the first step for the 600 or so biggest LSOAs or b) the population-weighted centroid for the 1,300 or so remaining LSOAs.

The first step attempts to find points where it might actually be possible to start a public transport journey, while the second step all but guarantees that it will be possible to start a car-based journey.


## Distance of Trip-points from Centroids

The plot below shows the distance of the trip-point from the population-weighted centroids for each LSOA.

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, results='hide'}
distance_plot <- ggplot(
  lsoa_trip_points %>% filter(distance_to_lsoa11_centroid_metres > 0), 
  aes(x=distance_to_lsoa11_centroid_metres,y=1, colour=place_type)) + 
  geom_quasirandom(groupOnX=FALSE) + 
  theme_minimal() + theme(
    axis.title.y = element_blank(), 
    axis.text.y = element_blank(), 
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(), 
    panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank()
  ) + 
  labs(x="Distance from Centroid to Trip-point (metres)") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=500*(0:16))
